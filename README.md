## Web Application with Ternium's Partnership
I worked on the backend of a web application that allowed receiving .csv files, then apply an anomaly identification model, and finally generate a report with the selected variables and graph types.

My main contribution was the management of the non-relational database with MongoDB and the WebAPI built with Django and Pymongo.
